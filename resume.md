AdamHarder.com miscellaneous side projects 

Short term web-application and software development projects for corporate
customers.  Common projects include translating business critical spreadsheets into 
shared web apps.  Primarily developed on AppFog / AWS and Google App Engine in Python.

I built the cost projection system for www.landeconics.com.

### Raytheon S.I. Government Solutions
2008 - 2011

Various embedded development projects with a focus on mobile phone platforms.
Implemented a complete ARMv6 disassembler using the test-driven development process and representative instruction unit test bed of 250,000 test cases
Worked with a small embedded team to:
repurpose a hardware debugging protocol into a data analysis tool
make calls into non-standard system drivers
perform black box testing and security auditing on third party software

Led a team of 8 engineers to develop a cell phone (agnostic) security test framework
Developed customer relationships that leveraged these successes to open new business areas.

###Harris Corporation
November 2006 - September 2008

Provided customer test support and product demonstration domestically and abroad

Sole developer tasked with retrofitting the software architecture for a GSM product for the UMTS protocol.  Used the OSS Nokalva ASN compiler to generate libraries for parsing UMTS layer 3 messages.
As development wrapped, I traveled to customer sites and supported testing.
From there I led a team of two to three developers to productize the UMTS prototype, as well as supporting the customer with prototype testing.  Our team was also given the ancillary task of developing a parser/compiler capable of creating C code from ASN specification documents.  Learned project scheduling, cost estimation and team leadership.

C++; MFC; Windows API; Visual Studio 6 & 2005;
SqlLite; Apache ANT; Xoreax IncrediBuild; InnoSetup; GOLD Parser; OSS Nokalva ASN C++ tools; ASN; CSN; UMTS; GSM; Doxygen

Project size (Line of code):
NEW: 19,000 // Re-engineered: 40,000 // Reused: 136,000


April - October 2006
Developed a design through Preliminary design review and Critical Design review for a set of enhancements to a GSM product.
Implemented a design for the User interface for a modem-based SMS product.  An interesting development task as the interfaces to the engine changed several times over the course of the development.
C++; MFC; Windows API; Visual Studio 6.0 & 2003; ChartFX COM component; Microsoft Chart COM component; U3 compliant USB package
Multi-tech and Sierra GSM modems (PCMCIA & USB)
